# AI-Driven-Drowsiness-Detection-System
A drowsiness detection system uses deep learning to analyze real-time cues like eye movement and facial expressions to detect fatigue. It provides timely alerts to enhance safety and prevent accidents.


• Implemented a real-time driver-monitoring solution using CNNs to detect closed eyes, minimizing accident risks by up to 30%.
• Utilized OpenCV for image acquisition and immediate alarm triggers upon prolonged eyelid closure.
• Achieved 95% accuracy through data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and extensive training.
